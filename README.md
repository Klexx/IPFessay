IPFessay
========

IPFessay is an application that runs on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and allows you
to publish uncensorable essays to it. It supports Markdown for composition and
lets you write and publish essays right from your browser, with no extra
software or servers.

As long as IPFS is up, you'll be able to use IPFessay to publish texts to IPFS.

To use IPFessay, just get it from IPFS (a link to the latest release will be
posted here as soon as one is made).
