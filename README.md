IPFessay
========

IPFessay is an application that runs on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and allows you
to publish uncensorable essays to it. It supports Markdown for composition and
lets you write and publish essays right from your browser, with no extra
software or servers.

As long as IPFS is up, you'll be able to use IPFessay to publish texts to IPFS.

To use IPFessay, you need to do a few things, unfortunately:

* [Install IPFS](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/).
* Launch the daemon in writable mode (`ipfs daemon --writable`).
* Add the [CORS headers](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api#cors) (an
  unfortunate necessity).
* Visit the following link:

[/ipfs/QmSSxSisEfnBHww4Ry58n6z36sLMczt1nxfDWYHCReBdmz](http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmSSxSisEfnBHww4Ry58n6z36sLMczt1nxfDWYHCReBdmz)

You can see a (non-functional) version of IPFessay on ipfs.io:
